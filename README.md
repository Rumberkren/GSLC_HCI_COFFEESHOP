# GSLC_HCI_COFFEESHOP
## Group Assignment for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) themed "Website for the Disabled"

My group decided to make a website for the blind.
The feature I added was pressing tab allows the user to skip the unnecessary text on the website and skip ahead to the main content of the website.
Even though the feature that I added was not for the fully blind, it was to help people with a vision impairment, so they don't have to read all the text on the website.
